            Hello it’s nice to meet you.
            I’m Leonie, let me tell you a bit about myself.
          </h1>
          <p>
            The first time I ever sat down to work on a website,
            I was a teenager and the tool of choice was Geocities.
            I was mesmerized and built website after website.
            I never expected that this was something people
            could do as a job though.
            Since then I’ve come quite a long way.
            After 2 studies in the field of Interaction Design I’ve
            become fascinated with the way people interact with
            technology and the way it interacts with them.
          </p>
          <p>
            Now I’m a Designer with 5+ years of experience in app- & webdesign. From interaction, through ux and into visual design. The full design package, as it were. I enjoy creating products that give joy to the people who use them and that make their world a little bit better, as you can see in the products that I’ve worked on so far.
