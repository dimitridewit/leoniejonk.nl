            <h1>
              Hello it’s nice to meet you.
              I’m Leonie, let me tell you a bit about myself.
            </h1>
            <p>
              The first time I ever sat down to work on a website,
              I was a teenager and the tool of choice was Geocities.
              I was mesmerized and built website after website.
              I never expected that this was something people
              could do as a job though.
              Since then I’ve come quite a long way.
              After 2 studies in the field of Interaction Design I’ve
              become fascinated with the way people interact with
              technology and the way it interacts with them.
            </p>
            <p>

              Now I’m a Designer with 5+ years of experience in app- & webdesign. From interaction, through ux and into visual design. The full design package, as it were. I enjoy creating products that give joy to the people who use them and that make their world a little bit better, as you can see in the products that I’ve worked on so far.
